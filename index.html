    <h3>RESPONSIVE WEBSITE</h3>
    <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.</p>
    
    
    <h3>MINIMALISM</h3>
<P>Many businesses are taking web design back to the basics with minimalistic designs and layouts. Websites are featuring fewer pages, with simpler designs and more blank space.

Some websites are also implementing what’s referred to as “Flat Design”. Flat web design uses two-dimensional/flat images which are aesthetically pleasing to look at, in combination with lots of open space, and bright colors. Flat design also meets the requirements of a responsive web design.</P>
    
    <h3>USER-FRIENDLY</h3>
    <P>Usability has always been of key importance in a successful website. Websites with an intuitive design, and with images and aspects that are pleasing to the eye are going to attract more customers than those without these features.

A simple, intuitive, and functional navigation is another important feature to focus on. If customers can’t easily make their way around your site, they aren’t likely to stay long.

The speed at which your pages load also have a strong impact on users in the coming year. Quickly loading pages and simple ways to get to specific information will be critical in setting your website apart from the competition. </P>
    
    <h3>PERSONALIZED USER EXPERIENCE</h3>
    <p>Personalized user experience web design is the norm. Rather than everyone receiving the same experience when visiting a particular website, a personalized user experience design allows for the content and experience to be designed specifically for a particular user.

The best part about websites that offer a personalized user experience, is that they are typically able to adapt to the visitor's interests and needs without having to do much at all.</p>
    
    <h3>BOLD COLORS</h3>

    <p>In the past, bright and bold colors on websites was sometimes perceived as childish or unprofessional, depending of course upon the industry of the business. However, websites with vibrant colors have become more popular and more acceptable in recent years. </p>
